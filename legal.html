          <p>Effective Date: April 20, 2023</p>
          <p>In this Website Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”), we, Parallel Wireless, Inc. (“Parallel”) provide information about how we collect, use, store, and transfer personally identifiable information sent to us by you through our websites and our careers application portal hosted and managed by a third party that shares your data with us, which may be found at <a href="https://www.parallelwireless.com/careers/">https://www.parallelwireless.com/careers/</a> (collectively “the Site”). Our Privacy Policy is part of our Terms of Use, accessible here (<a href="https://www.parallelwireless.com/privacy-policy/#terms">https://www.parallelwireless.com/privacy-policy/#terms</a>).</p>
          <p><strong>1. Scope</strong></p>
          <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to data collected through the Site and not any other data collection or processing including, without limitation, data we may collect offline or data collection practices of other web pages to which we link, or through websites, products or services that do not display a direct link to this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p><strong>2. Types of Data and Collection Methods</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Data you submit. </strong>When you request information, subscribe to or order a product or service, register as a user, respond to an online survey, submit an application for employment, or otherwise actively send us data, we usually collect data such as your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, and certain information related to you or the business you represent. In connection with chargeable services, we will also collect payment information, phone number, and billing and shipping addresses. In connection with applications for employment, the Site will also prompt you to provide employment and educational history, phone number, and other contact information. We sometimes partner with other organizations. When we do, we may present you with the option to share your email and personal information with the partner organization and to opt-in to their program. In each such instance, you will know what data we collect through the Site, because you actively submit it. We are not responsible for emails you receive from a partner organization or third party that has independently obtained your email (i.e., when Parallel does not provide your email to the third party), even if the email is a third party email promoting Parallel’s goods or services.</p>

For example, we may use third party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet or to display ads for other companies on our site.

However, if you become a registered Site user, some information on our membership lists, such as your name and mailing address, may be exchanged with other organizations. Members may opt out of such membership list exchanges by following the opt-out procedures described below. If you submit an application for employment through our careers page hosted by a third party, your data will be provided directly to such third party provider and Parallel will also share your information with other organizations necessary to perform the purpose for which you provided the data, namely, to verify employment and education history, perform background checks, and perform other necessary functions related to reviewing and responding to an application for employment.</p>
          <p><strong>4. Opting Out</strong></p>
          <p>If you no longer wish to receive communications from Parallel, you may email us at <a href="mailto:info@parallelwireless.com">info@parallelwireless.com</a> or click on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any email sent to you by Parallel. You should know that opting out or unsubscribing from our site does not delete your personal information from our system, which may exist in backup or disaster-recovery files. Even if you opt out, we may continue to contact you via email for administrative or informational purposes, including follow-up messages regarding the administration of your account, renewal of your membership, updates regarding the status of your application for employment, contests you have entered or other transactions you have undertaken.</p>
          <p><strong>5. Security</strong></p>
          <p>Parallel uses industry accepted data collection and encryption methodologies in an attempt to ensure the secure collection and transmission of sensitive user information. While we try our best to safeguard your personal information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>
          <p><strong>6. IP Addresses</strong></p>
          <p>An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you access the Internet. This number may be the same each time you access the Internet, or it may change. Like other Internet sites, Parallel uses IP addresses to collect aggregate information about numbers of visitors and Site usage. The address is logged on our server when your computer requests information from Parallel. Parallel reserves the right, in rare instances, to use IP addresses to identify individuals who threaten our site, service, or users.</p>
          <p><strong>7. EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”)</strong></p>
          <p>Parallel Wireless, Inc. is headquartered in Nashua, New Hampshire, United States with offices in India, Israel, and the United Kingdom.&nbsp; Where required, Parallel Wireless complies with the GDPR and other applicable data protection laws.</p>
          <p><strong>How we use personal data</strong></p>
          <p>In addition to Section 3 above, Parallel will use your personal data based on:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Our legitimate business interests: For example, when you provide your information to us in connection with marketing offers or solutions feedback. You may have the right to object to this use of your personal data. Please review the “Opting Out” and “Data Subject Rights” sections for more information.</li>
          <li>Contract: For example, we may process personal information of business contacts to establish a contract for goods or services between you and Parallel, maintain contact points, and send you invoices for ordered goods or services.</li>
          <li>Legal obligation: For example, when it is reasonably necessary for Parallel to retain your personal data to comply with a legal obligation on Parallel, such as tax laws, export control compliance, or to exercise or defend our legal rights.</li>
          <li>Consent: We will rely on your consent to retain and use your personal data if no other basis is relevant. You may have the right to object or withdraw your consent. Please review the “Opting Out” and “Data Subject Rights” sections for more information.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Data Transfers</strong></p>
          <p>To provide our products and services, including employment services, Parallel may transfer data across Parallel’s affiliate companies in different geographic locations. When we transfer personal data from the E.U. to the U.S., we do so in compliance with appropriate safeguards, such as signing E.U. Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>
          <p><strong>Data Subject Rights</strong></p>
          <p>Your local law may provide you with rights regarding the distribution and use of your personal data. For example, GDPR gives residents of the EU rights that they can exercise free of charge, including:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Right to correct your personal information</li>
          <li>Right to withdraw consent</li>
          <li>Right to access your personal data</li>
          <li>Right to data portability</li>
          <li>Right to data deletion</li>
          <li>Right to object to processing</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>8. Notice to California Residents</strong></p>
          <p>Except with regard to the alternative detailed below, residents of the State of California have the right to request a list of all third parties to which a company conducting business in California has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of your personal information by third parties for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise this choice.</p>
          <p>Parallel qualifies for this alternative option. We have a comprehensive privacy policy and provide you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. We are not required, therefore, to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your personal information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.</p>

          <p>The Site is intended for adults. We do not intentionally or knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. We request that children under the age of 13 not submit any information on the Site.</p>
